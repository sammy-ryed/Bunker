## What is this?

The apocalypse is here. Zombies, aliens, or radioactive fallout‚Äîtake your pick.  
You have **ONE shot** to get into the bunker.  

This is a **fun, thrilling simulation** where classmates compete to survive based on **priority**, not speed. First-come, first-served is dead.  

### Features

- Student login and admin login  
- Enter the queue to save yourself (if you‚Äôre lucky)  
- Priority-based survival  
- Admin can set bunker capacity and process the queue  
- As always we believe in BARF: Bugs: A Replaced Feature

## How it Works

1. **Login as a student**  
2. Click **‚ÄúEnter the Queue to Save Yourself‚Äù**  
3. Wait‚Ä¶ then check your **status**:     
   ‚úÖ Congrats, you got in!    
   ‚ùå Bye! Enjoy eating brains!    

4. Admins get extra powers:  

- Set **bunker capacity**  
- Process the queue  
- See who survived and who didn‚Äôt
